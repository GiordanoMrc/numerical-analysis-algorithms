Derive three different g(x) for finding roots to six correct decimal places of the following
f (x) = 0 by Fixed-Point Iteration. Run FPI for each g(x) and report results, convergence or
divergence. Each equation f (x) = 0 has three roots. Derive more g(x) if necessary until all
roots are found by FPI. For each convergent run, determine the value of S from the errors
e i+1 /e i , and compare with S determined from calculus as in (1.11). (a) f (x) = 2x 3 −
6x − 1 (b) f (x) = e x−2 + x 3 − x (c) f (x) = 1 + 5x − 6x 3 − e 2x
